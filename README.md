## Description

Writing about tech can be just as important as making it. Developers spend plenty of time creating new applications and debugging existing codebases, but most developers also spend at least some of their time reading and writing about technical concepts, recent advancements, and new technologies.

This project is a CMS-style blog site following the MVC paradigm, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developers’ posts as well.

The technologies used in this application are:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) to run the web server
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) to store the data
- [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org) as the object relational model to connect to the MySQL database from Node.js
- [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) to store environmental variables
- [express-handlebars](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-handlebars) as the templating engine
- [express-session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session) for authentication
